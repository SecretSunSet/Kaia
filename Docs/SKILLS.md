# Skills & Expert Channels

## General KAIA Skills

These run in the general channel through the intent detector + skill router:

| Skill | Triggers | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `chat` | General conversation | Q&A using user profile context |
| `memory` | "What do you know about me?", "Remember that..." | Profile queries + explicit storage |
| `reminders` | "Remind me..." | Create, list, edit, cancel reminders |
| `budget` | "Spent ₱500...", "How much did I spend?" | Log transactions, summaries, budget limits |
| `briefing` | "/briefing", "morning update" | Daily briefing with weather, news, agenda |
| `web_browse` | "Search for...", "What's the weather?" | Web search + summary |

## Expert Channels (Phase CH-1)

The team. All 4 channels work immediately via `PlaceholderExpert` — they respond in character using the channel persona from the DB. Specialized skills ship in subsequent phases.

| Command | Name | Role | Personality |
|---------|------|------|-------------|
| — (default) | 👑 KAIA | Team Lead | Warm, adaptive, main assistant. Routes to experts when relevant. |
| `/hevn` | 💰 Hevn | Financial Advisor | Business-minded, money-savvy, caring but direct. Knows PH finances. |
| `/kazuki` | 📈 Kazuki | Investment Manager | Elegant, strategic, patient. Long-term thinker, calm under volatility. |
| `/akabane` | ⚔️ Akabane | Trading Strategist | Surgical precision, fast execution, safety-first. Confirms every order. |
| `/makubex` | 🔧 MakubeX | Tech Lead / CTO | Systems thinker, hacker mindset, teaches at your level. |

### Meta-commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/team` | Show full roster (topic-based layout in forum mode) |
| `/exit` | Return to general KAIA (DM mode only) |
| `/setup_forum` | Create expert topics in a forum-enabled group (CH-1.1) |

### Channel switching — DM vs Forum (CH-1.1)

| Mode | How the active channel is chosen | Where the reply goes |
|------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| DM (private chat) | `/hevn`, `/kazuki`, …, `/exit` mutate `user_channel_state` | The DM |
| Forum group | The topic the message was posted in (via `forum_topic_mappings`) | Same topic (`message_thread_id` preserved) |
| Regular group (non-forum) | Ignored | — |

In forum mode the command-based switches are unnecessary — each expert has their own thread. The expert commands still work but redirect the user to the relevant topic rather than switching persistent state.

## Phase CH-1 Behavior (PlaceholderExpert)

Each expert channel, via `PlaceholderExpert`:

1. **Loads the channel's persona** from `channels.system_prompt` in the DB
2. **Loads combined context**: shared user profile + channel-specific profile
3. **First visit**: generates an in-character introduction with the top 2–3 knowledge gap questions woven in
4. **Subsequent visits**: responds in character using channel conversation history + one natural knowledge gap question (max)
5. **Saves conversation** to `channel_conversations` (separate from general KAIA history)
6. **Background extraction** with domain-focused prompt — only extracts domain-relevant facts (financial facts for Hevn, tech facts for MakubeX, etc.) to `channel_profile`
7. **Footer**: every response ends with `---\n💰 Hevn — Financial Advisor | /exit to return to KAIA`

## Specialized Skills Roadmap

| Phase | Expert | Status | Skills |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| CH-2 | Hevn | ✅ Done | Health assessment, budget coaching, goals, bills, market trends, education, proactive alerts |
| CH-3 | MakubeX | ⏳ Next | Code review, architecture, debugging, tech coaching |
| CH-4 | Kazuki | ⏳ Planned | Portfolio tracking, allocation, market research |
| CH-5 | Akabane | ⏳ Planned | Order management (Binance), risk control, trade journal |

Each phase replaces `PlaceholderExpert` in the registry with the specialized class.

## Hevn — Financial Advisor (Phase CH-2)

Replaces `PlaceholderExpert` with `HevnExpert` (`experts/hevn/expert.py`). Routing on every message:

1. **First-visit onboarding** — in-character intro, asks for income to bootstrap the profile; schedules the weekly digest.
2. **Intent classification** (`experts/hevn/parser.py`) — keyword short-circuit with AI JSON fallback, across 7 intents.
3. **Specialized routes** — for `health_assessment`, `goals`, `bills`, `budget_coaching` Hevn calls the skill directly and returns a deterministic, numbers-backed response.
4. **Persona-driven response** — for `market_trends`, `education`, `general_chat` Hevn replies via the AI with a system prompt enriched by the user's budget summary, goals overview, and current knowledge gap.
5. **Fire-and-forget extraction** — `hevn_extract_and_save` extracts financial facts into `channel_profile` and mirrors income/debt/savings/retirement/insurance/goals into the shared `user_profile` under category `"finances"`.

### Intent Categories

`experts/hevn/parser.py::classify_hevn_intent` routes to one of these:

| Intent | When it fires | Examples |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| `health_assessment` | User wants an overall financial evaluation | "How am I doing financially?", "Score my finances" |
| `goals` | User wants to **manage goal records** (create / update / list) | "Set a goal to save ₱50k", "Show my goals", "Let's set this as our first goal" |
| `bills` | Recurring bills / subscriptions / due dates | "Add my Netflix bill", "What's due this week?" |
| `budget_coaching` | Spending-pattern or waste analysis | "Where am I wasting money?", "Analyze my spending" |
| `market_trends` | Rates, markets, economic events | "What's the BSP rate?", "USD/PHP today" |
| `education` | Wants to learn a concept | "Explain MP2", "What is a UITF?" |
| `general_chat` | Open-ended conversation **OR advice-style questions** — "how much should", "should I", "is my ...", "what's a good" always route here so Hevn answers with personalized advice instead of hitting `goals.list()` | "How much should my emergency fund be?", "Should I invest or pay debt first?" |

The `general_chat` short-circuit for advice markers is what prevents the
"No active goals yet" regression where advice questions mentioning
"emergency fund" or "goal" were routed to the goals list.

When the user says "let's set this as our first goal" (no explicit
amount), `_run_goals` loads the last 6 Hevn messages via
`get_channel_conversations` and prepends them to the parser input so the
target amount can be resolved from Hevn's prior suggestion.

### The 7 Skills

| Skill | File | Highlights |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Financial Health | `skills/health_assessment.py` | Weighted 1–100 score across 5 components (savings 25%, debt 25%, emergency fund 25%, income stability 15%, expense control 10%). Uses 90-day transactions + Hevn's channel_profile. |
| Budget Coaching | `skills/budget_coaching.py` | Pattern analysis (top categories, weekend/weekday split, spike days, repeated vendors). Waste detection: food delivery, subscriptions > 5% of income, recurring micro-vendors. |
| Goals Manager | `skills/goals_manager.py` | Create/update/list goals; project timeline (on-track vs needed monthly); milestone celebrations at 25/50/75/100%; priority-weighted allocation suggestions. |
| Bills Tracker | `skills/bills_tracker.py` | Bills with computed `next_due`, 7-day upcoming view, monthly-total (normalized across recurrences), forgotten-subscription detection via transaction cross-reference. |
| Market Trends | `skills/market_trends.py` | BSP rate, PSEi, USD/PHP via web search; PH-filtered financial news; personalized impact explanations. |
| Education | `skills/education.py` | Topic catalog (basics/saving/investing/ph_specific/insurance/advanced); level inference from profile; level-adapted explanations; next-topic suggestions. |
| Proactive Alerts | `skills/proactive.py` | Weekly digest (Sunday 09:00), spending alerts, goal milestones, salary allocation on income-salary events. |

### Hevn Shortcut Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/hevn_health` | Run `FinancialHealthSkill` and reply with the report |
| `/hevn_goals` | Reply with the formatted goals overview |
| `/hevn_bills` | Reply with upcoming (7-day) bills, falling back to the full bill list |
| `/hevn_digest` | Generate the weekly digest on demand |

All four work in DM and Forum Topics mode (they respect `message_thread_id`).

### Scheduled Weekly Digest

- Registered on the user's first `/hevn` visit via `core.scheduler.schedule_hevn_weekly_digest`
- Fires every Sunday at 09:00 in the user's timezone (`CronTrigger(day_of_week='sun', hour=9)`)
- Delivered to Hevn's forum topic if `ForumManager.get_topic_for_channel` returns one, else DM with a `/hevn to discuss` footer

### Budget Tracker Integration

When the Budget skill logs an income transaction with category `salary`, it calls `_hevn_salary_allocation`. If the user has met Hevn (checked via `count_channel_conversations > 0`), `ProactiveAlertsSkill.handle_salary_received` suggests a 30% split across active goals and the suggestion is appended to the transaction confirmation.
