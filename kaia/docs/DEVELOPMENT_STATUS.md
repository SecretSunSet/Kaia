- [x] `core/skill_router.py` — Registered `BudgetSkill` in skill registry
- [x] `core/intent_detector.py` — Added budget edge case rules (plain numbers ≠ budget, need financial context)

### How to test

- Log expense: "Spent ₱500 on groceries" → verify confirmation, check `transactions` table
- Log income: "Received ₱30,000 salary" → verify income type
- Quick log: "Lunch 250" → should parse as expense, food, ₱250
- Summary: "How much did I spend this month?" → category breakdown with emojis
- Set budget: "Set food budget to ₱5,000 per month" → verify in `budget_limits` table
- Budget warning: Log food expenses until near ₱5,000 → verify warning appears

## Phase CH-3 — MakubeX (Tech Lead / CTO) ✅

### What's done

- Migration `005_makubex.sql`: `tech_projects`, `tech_skills`, `learning_log`, `code_reviews` with indexes + service-role RLS.
- `database/models.py` and `database/queries.py` extended with the four dataclasses and their CRUD helpers.
- New expert package `experts/makubex/`: `expert.py`, `prompts.py`, `parser.py`, `extractor.py`, plus 8 skills and the proactive weekly brief.
- Intent classifier with keyword short-circuits over 8 domains + AI fallback; fenced code blocks auto-route to `code_review`.
- `CodeReviewSkill` dedupes on SHA-256 snippet hashes so repeat pastes hit the cached result.
- `LearningCoachSkill` holds `SKILL_TREES` for python / web_dev / devops / databases / security and advances intro → solid → deep per topic.
- Memory extractor mirrors `tech_stack / skills / projects / work_context / infrastructure` into shared `user_profile` under `technical`.
- Scheduler `schedule_makubex_weekly_brief` fires Mondays 08:00 user local time; forum-mode delivery routes to MakubeX's topic when mapped.
- Slash shortcuts: `/makubex_review`, `/makubex_projects`, `/makubex_learn`, `/makubex_security`, `/makubex_brief`.

### How to test

- Open `/makubex` for the first time → onboarding in character, asks about current project + stack. Weekly brief auto-scheduled for next Monday 08:00.
- Paste a code block in `/makubex` → MakubeX review with severity-sorted issues. Paste the same block again → response says "cached".
- "Add a new project: foo in Python + FastAPI" → row appears in `tech_projects`, ack returned.
- `/makubex_projects` → list with status emojis.
- "Explain async/await" → learning coach response; row added to `learning_log`; next explain bumps depth.
- `/makubex_security` → audit of your first active project using its tracked stack.
- `/makubex_brief` → weekly tech brief on demand.
- Mention technical facts (e.g. "I'm on Python 3.11 with Supabase") → extractor mirrors to shared `user_profile` under `technical`.

---

## Known Issues

- Supabase-py client is synchronous — query functions are declared `async` but don't truly await I/O. Not a problem for single-user load. Consider `asyncpg` if scaling is needed.
- No virtual environment created yet on the dev machine (requires `python3-venv` package install with sudo). Dependencies installed with `--break-system-packages` for now.
- Intent detection adds one extra AI call per message (~64 output tokens). Minimal cost but doubles API calls. Consider caching or keyword-based pre-filtering for common patterns.
- Background memory extraction errors are silently logged — no retry mechanism. A failed extraction means facts from that conversation may be lost.
- Voice transcription requires Groq API key — without it, voice messages get a "not available" response. No fallback STT provider.
- Rate limiter state is in-memory only — resets on bot restart. Not an issue for single-instance deployment.
- Session AI cost tracking is in-memory — resets on restart. For persistent cost tracking, consider writing to DB.
- `/reset` deletes data from all child tables but does not delete the `users` row itself. User record persists for re-use.

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-04-08 | Use dataclasses over SQLAlchemy ORM | Lightweight, Supabase REST handles serialisation |
| 2026-04-08 | Polling over webhooks | Simpler deployment, no public URL needed |
| 2026-04-08 | Profile injection over RAG | Profile is small enough for system prompt |
| 2026-04-08 | Fire-and-forget asyncio task for extraction | Don't block user response; failed extractions are acceptable |
| 2026-04-08 | `<memory>` XML tags for structured data in AI response | Clean separation of machine-parseable facts from user-facing text |
| 2026-04-08 | Heuristic `_is_store_request()` before AI classification | Avoids burning an extraction call when we can cheaply detect "remember that..." patterns |
| 2026-04-08 | 64-token max for intent detection | Keeps classification fast and cheap — only need `{"skill":"x","confidence":0.9}` |
| 2026-04-12 | Own persistence over APScheduler job stores | All reminders stored in our `reminders` table, loaded into scheduler on startup. Gives us full control over state and portability |
| 2026-04-12 | UTC storage, local display for reminders | Store all times in UTC in DB, convert to user timezone only for display. Avoids DST ambiguity |
| 2026-04-12 | NLP parsing via Claude over regex | Natural language time parsing ("in 30 minutes", "tomorrow evening", "every Monday") handled by Claude rather than brittle regex patterns |
| 2026-04-12 | Claude for transaction parsing | Natural language financial inputs ("lunch 250", "spent ₱500 on groceries") parsed by Claude, not regex. Handles currency symbols, commas, categories |
| 2026-04-12 | Proactive budget warnings | Check category limit on every expense log, warn at 80% and alert when over — don't wait for user to ask |
| 2026-04-12 | Structured summaries over AI-generated | Budget summaries built from DB aggregates directly, not AI paraphrasing. Consistent format, faster, cheaper |
| 2026-04-12 | asyncio.gather for briefing sections | Fetch weather, reminders, budget, and AI note in parallel — briefing compiles in 2-3s instead of 10+ |
| 2026-04-12 | All external APIs optional | SerpAPI, NewsAPI, OpenWeatherMap each degrade gracefully. Bot works with zero, one, or all configured |
| 2026-04-12 | Template-first briefing, AI-enhanced | Structured format with emojis for scannability. Only motivational note uses Claude — keeps it fast and cheap |
| 2026-04-12 | CronTrigger for daily briefing | APScheduler CronTrigger in user's local timezone, auto-scheduled on startup for all allowed users |
| 2026-04-13 | Groq Whisper for STT over OpenAI Whisper | Free tier (30 req/min), same Whisper model, already have Groq client for AI fallback |
| 2026-04-13 | edge-tts over Google/ElevenLabs TTS | Completely free (Microsoft Edge voices), no API key needed, good quality |
| 2026-04-13 | In-memory rate limiter over DB-backed | Single-instance bot, no need for distributed rate limiting. 20 msg/min per user prevents API cost spikes |
| 2026-04-13 | Profile-based voice reply preference | User says "reply with voice" → stored in profile → checked on each voice message. No global flag needed |
| 2026-04-13 | CONFIRM DELETE safety flow for /reset | Irreversible data deletion requires exact text match within 2-minute window. Prevents accidental data loss |
